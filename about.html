            The systems were still performing.<br>
            But alignment was already gone.

            In the wealth management world, we tracked drift down to the decimal. Portfolio allocations, asset thresholds, tax loss harvesting triggers. It was all measurable. All monitored.
        </p>
        <p class="font-inter" style="font-size: 1.125rem; color: #141414; margin-bottom: 1.25rem;">
            But when the leadership team started misfiring—when decisions got political, when the room got quieter, when the truth started costing—there was no metric. No warning. Just deterioration that couldn’t be named until it was too late.
        </p>
        <p class="font-inter" style="font-size: 1.125rem; color: #141414;">
            That’s the cost of invisible drift. The system keeps running. But the people are gone.

            I build diagnostic infrastructure that detects Drift: when organizational execution has outpaced strategic alignment.

            My systems expose misalignment between performance and coherence—especially in high-velocity environments where traditional management structures fail.

            My work is shaped by two decades inside executive decision structures, culminating in leading a $1.5B private equity integration as COO. Now, I name the fracture points before they become institutional collapse.

            EthosSignal wasn’t built to inspire.

            It was built because executives were performing while breaking. Because leadership teams had velocity but no alignment. Because systems kept producing results—but no one knew what was eroding underneath.
        </p>
        <p class="font-inter" style="font-size: 1.125rem; color: #141414;">
            Drift Quotient™ exists to make the invisible measurable. Because if you can’t diagnose misalignment, you can’t fix it. You just keep scaling the collapse.
